        <h1><i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i></h1>
        <h2>By George Orwell</h2>
        
        <p>This novel is about the dystopian world set in 1984 (but the book itself released in 1949) where three totalitarian superstates are conquering the world after the World War II, where most of the world is being under the condition of endless war, extreme surveillance by the government and propaganda. Despite being released for a long time, this novel still influences many political actions.</p>
